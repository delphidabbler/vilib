Executable (binary) code

Permission is granted to anyone to use the executable (binary) version of the
Library, including modified versions, providing the source code of any modified

You may distribute the executable version, in original or modified form, with

   that you wrote the original software.
   
3. Modified versions of the library must be plainly marked as such, and must not
   be misrepresented as being the original software.

4. If you distribute a product that uses this Library, or a modified version of
   it, then somewhere in the product's supporting documentation you must place
   an acknowledgment of the library's author and copyright, a statement that the
   source code is available under the Mozilla Public License and information
   about how to obtain a copy of the source code. Acceptable documents include
   your product's readme file, your license file, the program's help file or any
   about box. The following statement will suffice, but suitable alternatives

   necessary.
